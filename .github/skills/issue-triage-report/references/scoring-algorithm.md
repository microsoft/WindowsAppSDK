# ScoringConfig.json – Field-by-Field Guide

This document explains every field in [`ScoringConfig.json`](../scripts/ScoringConfig.json) so you can tune issue highlight scoring without reading the PowerShell source. The config is loaded (and strictly validated) by `Get-ScoringConfig` in [`ReportLib.ps1`](../scripts/ReportLib.ps1).

> **All fields are required.** The loader throws if any section or field is missing — there are no hidden defaults.

## Top-Level Structure

```jsonc
{
  "weights":          { ... },   // How much each scoring factor matters (points)
  "thresholds":       { ... },   // Numeric cutoffs for highlight labels
  "labelPriority":    [ ... ],   // Order for assigning highlight labels
  "maxLabelsPerIssue": 2,        // Cap on highlight labels per issue
  "severityLabels":   { ... }    // Maps GitHub labels → severity tiers
}
```

## `weights` – Scoring Factor Points

Controls how many points each factor can contribute to the 0–100 composite score. The values **must** sum to 100 (or less, if you intentionally disable a factor by setting it to 0).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `reactions` | int | Max points from GitHub reaction count (👍 ❤️ 🚀 👀 🎉 😕 😄). Higher reaction counts award a larger fraction of this value. |
| `age` | int | Max points from issue age (days since creation). Older untriaged issues score higher. |
| `comments` | int | Max points from comment count. More discussion → higher score. |
| `severity` | int | Max points from severity label matching (see [`severityLabels`](#severitylabels--github-label-→-severity-tier)). |
| `blockers` | int | Max points for issues with blocking labels (`block`, `blocker`, `blocking`). Set to `0` to disable. |

### How points are awarded within each factor

The scoring engine divides each factor's weight into brackets. For example, with `"reactions": 30`:

| Raw Reactions | % of Weight | Points Awarded |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | 0% | 0 |
| 1–4 | 20% | 6 |
| 5–9 | 40% | 12 |
| 10–19 | 60% | 18 |
| 20–49 | 80% | 24 |
| 50+ | 100% | 30 |

The same 20/25/40/50/67/75/80/100% bracket pattern applies to `age` and `comments`. Changing the weight value scales all brackets proportionally.

**Severity** uses tier percentages instead (see below).

### Tuning tips

- **Emphasize community signal**: Increase `reactions` and `comments`, decrease `age`.
- **Prioritize backlog hygiene**: Increase `age`.
- **Re-enable blocker tracking**: Set `blockers` to a non-zero value (reduce other weights to keep the sum ≤ 100).

---

## `thresholds` – Highlight Label Cutoffs

These values control when an issue earns a highlight label (🌟 Popular, ⏰ Aging, 📈 Trending). They do **not** affect the numeric score — only whether a label badge appears.

```json
"thresholds": {
  "aging_days":        90,
  "trending_comments": 10,
  "trending_days":     14,
  "popular_reactions":  5
}
```

| Field | Type | Used By | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `aging_days` | int | ⏰ Aging | Issue must be open longer than this **and** carry the `needs-triage` label to get the Aging badge. |
| `trending_comments` | int | 📈 Trending | Minimum comment count required for the Trending badge. |
| `trending_days` | int | 📈 Trending | Issue must have been updated within this many days **and** meet `trending_comments` to qualify. Ensures "trending" means trending *now*, not historically. |
| `popular_reactions` | int | 🌟 Popular | Minimum total reactions to earn the Popular badge. |

### Tuning tips

- **Tighter Trending window**: Lower `trending_days` to 7 to surface only very recent activity.
- **Broader Popular threshold**: Lower `popular_reactions` to 3 if your repo gets fewer reactions.
- **Stricter Aging**: Raise `aging_days` to 180 if a 90-day backlog is normal.

## `labelPriority` – Highlight Label Order

Determines which highlight labels are assigned first when an issue qualifies for more than `maxLabelsPerIssue` labels. Labels earlier in the array win.

```json
"labelPriority": [
  "regression",
  "blocker",
  "popular",
  "aging",
  "trending"
]
```

| Position | Internal Name | Display Label | Condition |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | `regression` | 🐛 Regression | Issue has a `regression` GitHub label |
| 2 | `blocker` | 🚧 Blocker | Issue has a label matching `block\|blocker\|blocking` |
| 3 | `popular` | 🌟 Popular | Reactions ≥ `thresholds.popular_reactions` |
| 4 | `aging` | ⏰ Aging | Days open > `thresholds.aging_days` AND has `needs-triage` label |
| 5 | `trending` | 📈 Trending | Comments ≥ `thresholds.trending_comments` AND updated within `thresholds.trending_days` |

### Example

An issue with a `regression` label, 20 reactions, and 15 comments qualifies for Regression, Popular, and Trending. With `maxLabelsPerIssue: 2`, it receives **🐛 Regression** and **🌟 Popular** (positions 1 and 3 beat position 5).

---

## `maxLabelsPerIssue` – Label Cap

```json
"maxLabelsPerIssue": 2
```

Maximum number of highlight labels attached to any single issue. After the engine evaluates all conditions (in `labelPriority` order), it keeps only the first N labels. Increase this if you want richer badge detail; decrease to keep reports cleaner.

---

## `severityLabels` – GitHub Label → Severity Tier

Maps GitHub issue label strings to four severity tiers. The scoring engine walks tiers top-to-bottom and awards points based on the **first matching label** it finds.

```json
"severityLabels": {
  "critical": ["regression", "crash", "hang", "data-loss", "P0"],
  "high":     ["bug", "P1"],
  "medium":   ["performance", "feature proposal", "feature-proposal", "P2"],
  "low":      ["documentation", "enhancement", "P3"]
}
```

| Tier | % of `weights.severity` | Points (when severity=10) | When to use |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `critical` | 100% | 10 | Regressions, crashes, data loss |
| `high` | 80% | 8 | Confirmed bugs |
| `medium` | 50% | 5 | Performance issues, feature proposals |
| `low` | 20% | 2 | Docs, enhancements |

### Customization

- **Add a label**: Append it to the appropriate tier array (e.g., add `"memory-leak"` to `critical`).
- **Reclassify a label**: Move it between tier arrays.
- **Support custom P-labels**: The arrays already include `P0`–`P3`; add `P4`, `P5`, etc. to `low` if needed.
- **Order within a tier** doesn't matter — the engine matches the first label found on the issue against all tiers, checking from `critical` down to `low`.

---

## Composite Score Formula

```
Total = reactions_pts + age_pts + comments_pts + severity_pts + blockers_pts
      = weights.reactions + weights.age + weights.comments + weights.severity + weights.blockers
      = 100 max (with current defaults)
```

### Worked Example

Issue #2894 with 25 reactions, open 120 days, 8 comments, labeled `bug`:

| Factor | Raw | Bracket | Points |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| Reactions | 25 | 20–49 → 80% | 24/30 |
| Age | 120 days | 91–180 → 75% | 22/30 |
| Comments | 8 | 6–10 → 67% | 20/30 |
| Severity | `bug` | high → 80% | 8/10 |
| Blockers | — | disabled | 0/0 |
| **Total** | | | **74/100** |

---

## LLM Confidence Review

Deterministic scripts in this skill no longer compute confidence values. They produce the score, score breakdown, and highlight labels only.

If a final report includes `[confidence:XX]`, that value must be assigned by the agent after reviewing the scored issue, its labels, the issue body, and recent discussion.

Recommended rubric:

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **80-100** | High | Strong textual and scoring evidence supports highlighting the issue |
| **60-79** | Medium-High | Good support with limited ambiguity |
| **40-59** | Medium | Plausible highlight, but evidence is mixed or incomplete |
| **20-39** | Low | Weak supporting context beyond the numeric score |
| **0-19** | Very Low | The agent cannot confidently defend the highlight |

```powershell
# Find high-confidence highlights in an agent-reviewed report
Select-String -Path report.md -Pattern '\[confidence:[89][0-9]\]'

# Find low-confidence highlights in an agent-reviewed report
Select-String -Path report.md -Pattern '\[confidence:[0-4][0-9]\]'
```

---

## Validation Rules

`Get-ScoringConfig` in `ReportLib.ps1` enforces these constraints at load time — if any fail, the script throws immediately:

| Rule | Error if violated |
|------|-------------------|
| File must be named `ScoringConfig.json` | `ConfigPath must point to ScoringConfig.json` |
| Top-level sections `weights`, `thresholds`, `maxLabelsPerIssue`, `severityLabels` must all exist | `missing required section: '<name>'` |
| `weights` must contain: `reactions`, `age`, `comments`, `severity`, `blockers` | `'weights' missing required field: '<name>'` |
| `thresholds` must contain: `aging_days`, `trending_comments`, `trending_days`, `popular_reactions` | `'thresholds' missing required field: '<name>'` |
| `severityLabels` must contain: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | `'severityLabels' missing required level: '<name>'` |

`labelPriority` is the only optional field — if omitted, highlight labels are still assigned by the hardcoded priority in `Get-HighlightLabels`.

|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `Get-ScoringConfig` | Loads and validates `ScoringConfig.json`. Returns a hashtable consumed by every other function. | All fields (validation only) |
| `Get-IssueScore` | **Canonical scorer.** Takes one issue + config, returns a hashtable with per-factor scores (`Reactions`, `Age`, `Comments`, `Severity`, `Blockers`), raw values, and `Total`. | `weights.*`, `severityLabels.*` |
| `Get-HighlightLabels` | Evaluates label conditions and returns up to `maxLabelsPerIssue` badge strings (e.g., `🌟 Popular`). Checks in `labelPriority` order. | `thresholds.*`, `maxLabelsPerIssue` |

#### Helper Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Get-TotalReactions` | Sums `users.totalCount` across all `reactionGroups` on an issue. |
| `Get-IssueAgeInDays` | Calculates `(UTC now − createdAt)` in whole days. |
| `Test-HasLabel` | Exact-match check for a single label name on an issue. |
| `Test-HasLabelMatching` | Regex-match check for a label pattern (e.g., `block\|blocker`). |
| `Format-IssueLink` | Returns `[#NNN](url)` markdown link. |

#### `Get-IssueScore` Return Shape

```powershell
@{
    Reactions      = [int]    # Points awarded (0 – weights.reactions)

### `Get-HighlightScore.ps1` — Single-Issue Scorer

Location: `./scripts/Get-HighlightScore.ps1`

CLI tool that fetches one issue from GitHub and displays its score breakdown.

#### Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Get-DetailedIssueScore` | Wraps `Get-IssueScore` (ReportLib) and adds presentation metadata — reason strings (e.g., `"🌟 Popular (community interest)"`) and `MaxScore` per factor. Does **not** duplicate scoring math. |
| `Format-ScoreBreakdown` | Renders the visual bar-chart output (`█░`) with factor-by-factor breakdown, total score, and a priority recommendation (HIGH / MEDIUM / NORMAL / LOW). |

#### Usage

```powershell
# Quick score
./scripts/Get-HighlightScore.ps1 -IssueNumber 4651

# Detailed breakdown with visual bars
./scripts/Get-HighlightScore.ps1 -IssueNumber 4651 -Verbose

# Custom config path
./scripts/Get-HighlightScore.ps1 -IssueNumber 4651 -ConfigPath .\custom-config.json
```

#### Output (Verbose)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Issue #4651: Example issue title
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SCORE BREAKDOWN:
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Reactions    [████░░░░░░] 12/30  (raw: 7)
               └─ 🌟 Popular (community interest)
  Age          [██████████] 30/30  (raw: 200)
               └─ ⏰ Aging (needs triage for 200 days)
  Comments     [████████░░] 20/30  (raw: 8)
  Severity     [████████░░]  8/10  (raw: bug)
               └─ 🟠 High: bug
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       TOTAL SCORE: 70 / 100

  Recommendation: 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Should be highlighted in triage report

---

### `Validate-FeatureAreaReport.ps1` — Live Counts

Location: `./scripts/Validate-FeatureAreaReport.ps1`

Queries live issue counts per area and prints a formatted console table. **Does not use `ScoringConfig.json` or any scoring functions** — it only counts open, needs-triage, proposal, and closed (30-day) issues.

Use this script to sanity-check raw numbers before interpreting scored highlights.

---

### `Get-AreaContacts.ps1` — Contact Lookup

Location: `./scripts/Get-AreaContacts.ps1`

Manages the area → contact mapping. **Does not use `ScoringConfig.json`** — it reads from `area-contacts.json` (user copy at `.user/issue-triage-report/area-contacts.json`, template at `references/area-contacts.json`).

---

## Config → Function Cross-Reference

Quick lookup: which function reads which `ScoringConfig.json` field.

## Special Report Indicators

These are not configured in `ScoringConfig.json` but appear in report output:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0️⃣🐛🥳` | Feature area has zero open bugs |
| `🆕` | New area with no historical data |
| `N/A` | `area-External` — issues pending redirection to other teams |
