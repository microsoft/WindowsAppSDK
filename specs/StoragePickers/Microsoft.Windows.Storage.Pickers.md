Microsoft.Windows.Storage.Pickers Namespace
===

The `Microsoft.Windows.Storage.Pickers` API in the Windows App SDK lets desktop applications (like 
WinUI3) present a streamlined UI for selecting files or folders, modifying filenames and extensions, 
and accessing paths â€” all while integrating seamlessly across Windows desktops.

# Background

The standard OS file and folder picker APIs [Windows.Storage.Pickers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers) 
do not work when running as an administrator. To address this gap, here we're introducing the new
`Microsoft.Windows.Storage.Pickers` API by enabling file and folder selection in elevated mode. 
It is designed for desktop apps and uses a `WindowId` property to link the picker to its host window.

## Classes
