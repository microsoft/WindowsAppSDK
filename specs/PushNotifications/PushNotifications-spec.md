# Push Notifications in Project Reunion SDK

# Background

The Windows Push Notification Service (WNS) enables third-party developers to send toast, tile, badge, <br/>
and raw updates from their own cloud service. This provides a mechanism to deliver new updates to your <br/>
users in a power-efficient and dependable way. For example, the skype app service can triggering an incoming <br/>
call toast by Pushing a Payload to the WNS service. Push is generally used for time critical <br/>
events that require immediate user/developer action. 

* [The Push notification WinRT Public APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.networking.pushnotifications?view=winrt-19041)
  Defines the classes that encapsulate Push notifications. (UWP and Win32)
* [The Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/windows-push-notification-services--wns--overview) Defines how an app today can subscribe to Push Notifications and send a payload down to the corresponding client.

The below diagram is an illustration of the overall Push Flow that we have today:<br/>

## The problems today

**Portal Registration**: The entire Registration flow for Push is dependent on registering an app in the <br/>
partner center portal by [associating an app with the Windows Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-wns-push-notification). As a result, non-store provisioned <br/>
apps cannot use this feature.

**Client Registration**: Unpackaged 3rd party applications cannot register themselves as a Push target.<br/> 
The only way to get an implicit client side registration is to package the app as an MSIX Desktop Bridge<br/>
or SSP which may not satisfy 3rd party requirements.

**Push Channels**: All the channel APIs are dependent on the caller app having a store provisioned identity.<br/>
This means that Win32 and unpackaged apps that are not store distributed cannot use our Public APIs.<br/>
Sideloaded UWPs have exactly the same problem. <br/>

**Activation**: When the OS receives a Push over the WNS socket, it signals the Background <br/>
Infrastructure to trigger a task and run some code on the app's behalf. This flow is undefined for Win32 apps <br/>
that need to use Push today due to the limitations described above. 

**Channel Request Error Handling**: The channel APIs exposed today can throw exceptions via their Projections <br/>
Some errors can be critical errors while others are retryable errors. The msdn guidance for retrying isn't <br/>
very clear and has been the root cause of multiple app bugs in the past. We want to abstract away the details of <br/>
channel retry operations for developers in Project Reunion.

# Description

At a high level, we need to provide a way for all Win32 applications to subscribe to and receive Push notifications <br/>
irrespective of their app type. This includes unpackaged apps and packaged win32 (MSIX Desktop Bridge, Sparse Signed Packages). <br/>
Moreover, all Push scenarios should adhere to OS resource management policies like Power Saver, Network Attribution, <br/>
Enterprise group policies etc. The Project Reunion Push component will abstract away the complexities of dealing with WNS <br/>
channel registrations and Push related activations as much as possible freeing the developer to focus on other app <br/>
related challenges. 

We will prioritize the following feature set for Project Reunion:
* Supporting raw push for Packaged Win32(MSIX Desktop Bridge)
* Supporting raw push for Unpackaged Win32.
* Supporting Visual Cloud Toasts for packaged Win32 apps.
* Supporting Visual Cloud Toasts for unpackaged Win32 apps.

A Portal Registration flow through [AAD (Azure Active Directory)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) will also be defined that removes the dependency of the Push Flow with <br/>
the Partner Center Portal. The RemoteIdentifier GUID in this spec maps to the ApplicationId(ClientId) in the AAD App <br/>
Registration process. Below  is an illustration of the proposed flow through AAD:<br/>
![Push Flow For Project Reunion](Push.png)

Phase 1 (Project Reunion Preview):<br/>
WNS Push APIs will only support WIN32 Packaged app (MSIX Desktop Bridge).

Phase 2 (Project Reunion V1):<br/>
WNS Push APIs will support unpackaged Win32 scenarios.

# Examples

## In this scenario, the process that Registers the Push Activator and the process specified as the COM server are the same
The code in Main would follow the pattern below:
* The Registration will take in a CLSID of the COM server as part of the Activator setup. The registration API will simply be <br/>
a thin wrapper around the BackgroundInfra WinRT APIs and abstract away the COM details from the developer including registration <br/>
of the inproc Project Reunion component.
* The app will query ApplifeCycle APIs to retrieve an ActivationKind. (Note: This is covered in a seperate AppLifeCycle API spec.)
* If the Activation is Push, the app will QI the Arguments property to retrieve an instance of PushActivatedEventArgs and get <br/>
the Push payload from it. Care needs to be taken to Get a Deferral and Complete the Deferral while processing the payload for <br/>
Power Management compliance.
* If the Activation is Foreground, the app will do 2 things:
  * It will request a Push Channel Asynchronously with an implementation of Progress and Completed event handler.
    * Expect Channel operations to take around 2-16 minutes in some rare cases (retryable errors). In the 90th percentile case, <br/>
    it should be fairly quick operation (in a few seconds). 
  * It will subscribe to a In-memory Push event handler hanging off the retrieved Push Channel component.
    * The app should ideally handle the event by setting the Handled property to true to prevent Background Activation from <br/>
    launching a new process.

```cpp
int main()
{
    // Register the COM Activator GUID
    PushNotificationActivationInfo info(
        PushNotificationRegistrationKind::PushTrigger | PushNotificationRegistrationKind::ComActivator,
        winrt::guid("BACCFA91-F1DE-4CA2-B80E-90BE66934EC6"));

    // Registers a Push Trigger and sets up an inproc COM Server for Activations
    auto token = PushNotificationManager::RegisterActivator(info);

    // Check to see if the WinMain activation is due to a Push Activator
    // Note: This API is currently not present in Reunion but will be included as part of the AppLifecycle Public API spec.
    auto activation = AppLifecycle::Activation();
    auto kind = activation.Kind();

    if (kind == ReunionActivationKind::Push)
    {
        auto args = activation.Arguments().as<PushNotificationReceivedEventArgs>();

        // Call GetDeferral to ensure that code runs in low power
        auto deferral = args.GetDeferral();

        auto payload = args.Payload();

        // Do stuff to process the raw payload

        // Call Complete on the deferral as good practise: Needed mainly for low power usage
        deferral.Complete();
    }
    else if (kind == ReunionActivationKind::Launch) // This indicates that the app is launching in the foreground
    {
        // Register the AAD RemoteIdentifier for the App to receive Push
        auto channelOperation = PushNotificationManager::CreateChannelAsync(
            winrt::guid("F80E541E-3606-48FB-935E-118A3C5F41F4"));

        // Setup the inprogress event handler
        channelOperation.Progress(
            [](
                IAsyncOperationWithProgress<PushNotificationCreateChannelResult, PushNotificationCreateChannelStatus> const& sender,
                PushNotificationCreateChannelStatus const& args)
            {
                if (args.status == PushNotificationChannelStatus::InProgress)
                {
                    // This is basically a noop since it isn't really an error state
                    printf("The first channel request is still in progress! \n");
                }
                else if (args.status == PushNotificationChannelStatus::InProgressRetry)

                        args.extendedError,
                        "The channel request is in back-off retry mode because of a retryable error! Expect delays in acquiring it. RetryCount = %d",
                        args.retryCount);
                }
            });

        winrt::event_token pushToken;

        // Setup the completed event handler
        channelOperation.Completed(
            [&](
                IAsyncOperationWithProgress<PushNotificationCreateChannelResult, PushNotificationCreateChannelStatus> const& sender,
                AsyncStatus const asyncStatus)
            {
                auto result = sender.GetResults();
                if (result.Status() == PushNotificationChannelStatus::CompletedSuccess)
                {
                    auto channelUri = result.Channel().Uri();
                    auto channelExpiry = result.Channel().ExpirationTime();

                    // Register Push Event for Foreground
                    pushToken = result.Channel().PushReceived([&](const auto&, PushNotificationReceivedEventArgs args)
                    {
                        auto payload = args.Payload();

                        // Do stuff to process the raw payload

                        // Stop the subsequent background activation from launching process again with this payload
                        args.Handled(true);
                    });

                        // Persist the channelUri and Expiry in the App Service for subsequent Push operations
                }
                else if (result.Status() == PushNotificationChannelStatus::CompletedFailure)
                {
                    LOG_HR_MSG(result.ExtendedError(), "We hit a critical non-retryable error with channel request!");
                }
            });

        // Draw window and other foreground UI stuff here

        // Unregister the Push event for Foreground before exiting
        auto result = channelOperation.GetResults();
        if (result.Status() == PushNotificationChannelStatus::CompletedSuccess)
        {
            result.Channel().PushReceived(pushToken);
        }
    }

    // Unregisters the inproc COM Activator before exiting
    PushNotificationManager::UnregisterActivator(token, PushNotificationRegistrationKind::ComActivator);

    return 0;
}
```

## In this scenario, the process that Registers the Push Trigger and the process specified as the COM server are different.
Process A (Registration of the Push Trigger only):
```cpp
int main()
{
    PushNotificationActivationInfo info(
        PushNotificationRegistrationKind::PushTrigger,
        winrt::guid("BACCFA91-F1DE-4CA2-B80E-90BE66934EC6"));

    // Registers a Push Trigger with the Background Infra component
    auto token = PushNotificationManager::RegisterActivator(info);

    // Some app code ....

    return 0;
}
```
Process B (Register the inproc COM server and handle the background activation):
```cpp
int main()
{
    PushNotificationActivationInfo info(
        PushNotificationRegistrationKind::ComActivator,
        winrt::guid("BACCFA91-F1DE-4CA2-B80E-90BE66934EC6"));

    // Registers the current process as an InProc COM server
    auto token = PushNotificationManager::RegisterActivator(info);

    // Check to see if the WinMain activation is due to a Push Activator
    // Note: This API is currently not present in Project Reunion but will be included as part of the AppLifecycle Public API spec.
    auto activation = AppLifecycle::Activation();
    auto kind = activation.Kind();

    if (kind == ReunionActivationKind::Push)
    {
        // Do Push processing stuff
    }

    // Some code ....

    // Unregisters the inproc COM Activator
    PushNotificationManager::UnregisterActivator(token, PushNotificationRegistrationKind::ComActivator);

    return 0;
}
```
## Registration of the Push Activator for LOW IL apps like UWP (Inproc)
The app will simply call into the Default implementation of PushNotificationActivationInfo for the Registration Flow instead of the CLSID overload.
```cpp
PushNotificationActivationInfo info();
auto token = PushNotificationChannelManager::RegisterPushNotificationActivator(info);
```

To intercept the payload, OnBackgroundActivated will have to be implemented by the app.
```cpp
sealed partial class App : Application
{
  ...

  protected override void OnBackgroundActivated(BackgroundActivatedEventArgs args)
  {
      base.OnBackgroundActivated(args);
      IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance = args.TaskInstance;
      DoYourBackgroundWork(taskInstance);  
  }
}
```

# Remarks

## Registration
The developer should always call the Push Registration API first to register the current process as <br/>
the COM server before retrieving the PushActivationArgs. Order matters!

## Foreground API calls
It is recommended that the developer subscribes to channel requests and Push events if the app is launched <br/>
in foreground context. This is to ensure that subsequent Push and channel events can be handled by the 
<br/>running process.

## Seperating Activator Registration flow from Channel Request flow
We decided to have the following 2 APIs to be seperate calls instead of a single combined API call:
```cpp
PushNotificationChannelManager::RegisterActivator(info)
PushNotificationChannelManager::CreatePushChannelAsync(remoteIdentifier)
```
Mainly for 2 reasons:
* The app developer is expected to Register an activator for every WinMain app launch. Combining the channel <br/>
request API with the registration call would force the developer to keep the client channel in sync with the <br/>
App Service more frequently (both for foreground and background launch) which can cause potential synchronization <br/>
bugs. The preference is for developers to request new channels only on Foreground launches triggered by the user.
* It isn't required that developers Register a Push Activator for Visual Toast operations. In the case of <br/>
Visual Toasts, payloads are directed to the Shell and not to the App.

## Handling Push ChannelFailures
PushNotification channel request calls are expected to fail since they go over the wire. We don't want the developer <br/>
to deal with the complexities of retryable failures and critical failures. We do however expose in-progress states and </br>
internal error codes to developers if they prefer to track it for debugging, settings user expectations etc. <br/>

For example, we have 2 different Progress states, one indicating basic progress and another indicating retry progress.
```cpp
if (args.Status() == ChannelStatus::InProgress)
{
    // This is basically a noop since it isn't really an error state
    printf("The first channel request is still in progress! \n");
}
else if (args.Status() == ChannelStatus::InProgressRetry)
{
    LOG_HR_MSG(args.ExtendedError(), "The channel request is in back-off retry mode because of a retryable error! Expect delays in acquiring it.");
}
```

Similarly, operations are expected to fail or succeed on completion.
```cpp
if (result.Status() == ChannelStatus::CompletedSuccess)
{
    auto channelUri = result.Channel().Uri();
    auto channelExpiry = result.Channel().ExpirationTime();

    // Persist the channelUri and Expiry in the App Service
}
else if (result.Status() == ChannelStatus::CompletedFailure)
{
    LOG_HR_MSG(result.ExtendedError(), "We hit a critical non-retryable error with channel request!");
}
```

## Manifest Registration
For MSIX, the COM activator GUID and the exe path need to be registered in the manifest. The launch args would need to be pre set to a well-known string that defines Push Triggers. 
```xml
<Extensions>
  <com:Extension Category="windows.comServer">
    <com:ComServer>
      <com:ExeServer Executable="SampleBackgroundApp\SampleBackgroundApp.exe" DisplayName="SampleBackgroundApp" Arguments="-PushServer">
        <com:Class Id="{GUIDEntryPoint}" />
      </com:ExeServer>
    </com:ComServer>
  </com:Extension>
</Extensions>
```

# Appendix
* For all OS images before 21H1 (19043), the RemoteId will be a noop and the native platform will </br>
send the PFN (PackageFamilyName) in the channel request protocol. The WNS server will maintain an </br>
internal mapping of PFN -> RemoteId and will return a channelUri with the encoded RemoteId after querying </br>
the map.
* For OS images 21H1(19043) and beyond, the Project Reunion component will call into newly added Closed source </br>
APIs in the OS to actually pass a RemoteId in the Channel Request operation.
* For unpackaged Win32 apps, the Project Reunion component will call into Closed source APIs to register the </br>
unpackaged Win32 process with the RemoteId.
* A long running Project Reunion component will be needed to intercept Push payloads from the native platform and </br>
Launch the corresponding unpackaged Win32 app. We will be using Protocol Activation via WinMain to launch the </br>
unpackaged Win32 process from the long running service. The requirement is mainly because the native client </br>
today does not have support to launch Win32 apps directly in response to a Push payload unless they are </br>
already running in which case we simply marshall the payload back to the process via a registered callback sink.
* For packaged applications like MSIX Desktop Bridge, we buid a thin wrapper around existing Background Manager </br>
APIs rather than re-inventing new Background Triggers. This is mainly because Background Infrastructure native </br>
client stack is built with Power Management and resourcing concerns already addressed. Building a new stack that </br>
addresses similar concerns is likely not the best use of our time or resources. Instead we should invest in </br>
Reunioninzing the Background Infra stack itself.
