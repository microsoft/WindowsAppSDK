# Windows App SDK Roadmap

This roadmap frames how the Windows Development Platform team will deliver the Windows App SDK (WinAppSDK) and various technologies contained within, focused on the year ahead. It is intended to be the best entry point to conceptualize what's happening in the WinAppSDK, so you can form plans/strategies around this technology.
Details of this roadmap may change, and when they do, we'll strive to update the roadmap with the new information in a timely way. We aim to update this roadmap after every major public release (such as 1.4.0) when the details for the next release are ready to share.

## Mission

We aim to grow Windows App SDK to provide a modern, simple, and accessible version of much of the power of the Windows Application Platform. Working in the open with our development community ensures we're doing the right things first to solve problems your apps are facing on current and future versions of Windows.

Some functionality will be delivered first as Windows App SDK components. As we think about evolving the platform it's important to make sure new functionality & features are available to our developer community just as soon as they're ready to go. Where there's newer in-platform functionality to use Windows App SDK will help you adopt that as soon as it's widely available, without you having to retarget or rewrite - the same Windows App SDK API surface will continue to work.

As your app uses more Windows App SDK functionality it'll be ready for additional targets such as packaging, identity, AppContainer, and other future Windows Editions. Depending on Windows App SDK APIs means we take on the work to keep these APIs working as Windows evolves forward. Staying within the Windows App SDK API surface ensures your app can address the widest range of Windows editions and releases while using up-to-date functionality.

## Road to the next release

Our next WinAppSDK release will be version 1.7, expected to arrive around 25H1. In this release, the main goals are to focus on quality, performance, and a smoother overall user and developer experience.
