**Learning:** Returning small static containers (like std::unordered_map) by value can cause significant overhead in tight loops due to repeated copying. Additionally, performing string operations like `substr()` inside a loop for every character can be extremely expensive (~90% slower) compared to only performing them when a specific trigger character (e.g., '%') is encountered.
**Action:** Always return static containers by const reference. Use `reserve()` for string building when the size is known or can be estimated. Add early-exit checks in parsing loops to skip expensive substring/allocation operations.
